# 0x19. C - Stacks (Last in, first out), Queues (First in, first out)
This repository contains solutions to the ALX MONTY project.
# MONTY
Monty is a high-level programming language that is designed to be easy to learn and use. It is an interpreted language, which means that code written in Monty is executed directly without the need for compilation. The syntax of Monty is gramming concepts, particularly those related to data structures and algorithms.
Monty was created by Holberton School as a tool to teach students programming concepts, particularly those related to data structures and algorithms. It has a small and simple set of built-in functions and data types, which makes it easy to learn and use (chatGPT).
# The Monty Language
Monty 0.98 is a scripting language that is first compiled into Monty byte codes (Just like Python). It relies on a unique stack, with specific instructions to manipulate it. The goal of this project is to create an interpreter for Monty ByteCodes files.
# Monty byte code file
Files containing Monty byte codes usually have the .m extension. Most of the industry uses this standard but it is not required by the specification of the language. There is not more than one instruction per line. There can be any number of spaces before or after the opcode and its argument.
Monty has built-in support for stacks and queues through its data structures.
# STACK
A stack is a data structure that follows the LIFO (last in, first out) principle. This means that the last element added to the stack is the first one to be removed. The name "stack" comes from the way elements are added and removed from the collection, which resembles a stack of items. It uses two basic operations: push which is used to add elements to the top of a stack and pop which is used to remove elements from the top of a stack. It also uses other operations such as peek (which returns the top element without removing it) and clear (which removes all elements from the stack. Stack is typically implemented using array (static memory) or linked list (dynamic memory).

# QUEUE
A queue is is a data structure that follows the FIFO (first in, first out) principle. This means that first element added to the queue is the first one to be removed. A queue is similar to a stack, but the order of elements is different. It resembles a line of people waiting to be served. A queue uses two basic operations: enqueue, which adds an element to the back of the queue, and dequeue, which removes the front element from the queue. Queues are typically implemented using an array (static memory) or a linked list (dynamic memory).
